# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the Amazon Vine Analysis

### Purpose

In this analysis I will be examining a dataset that contains reviews of baby products and using PySpark I will determine if there is any bias toward favourable reviews from Vine members. 


## Amazon Vine Analysis Results

- **How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?**

Non-Vine reviews: 25,094

Vine reviews: 463
 
- **How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**

Non-Vine 5-star reviews: 12,235

Vine 5-star reviews: 202

- **What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**

Non-Vine 5-star review percentage: 48.76%

Vine 5-star review percentage: 43.63%

## Amazon Vine Summary

In conclusion, there is no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program since the percentage of Vine 5-star reviews was almost identical to the percentage of non-vine 5-star reviews (an exact difference of 5.13%). To further confirm, I would suggest running this same analysis on 4-star reviews to determine if the results are similar.
